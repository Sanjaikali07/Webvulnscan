# Web Vulnerability Scanner

A basic web vulnerability scanner focused on detecting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This lightweight tool is built with Flask for the backend server and BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content. Ideal for students and beginners in the cybersecurity field who want hands-on experience with web vulnerability scanning.

## Features

* Detects basic reflected XSS vulnerabilities in GET parameters.
* Simple web-based interface for scanning.
* Displays vulnerable parameters and affected URLs.
* Written in Python for readability and easy customization.
* Uses BeautifulSoup to parse and analyze web pages.

## How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the app:

```bash
python app.py
```

### 3. Open in browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## Usage

* Enter the target URL in the input form.
* The scanner will crawl the URL and analyze query parameters.
* If any reflected XSS vectors are detected, they will be listed on the results page.

## Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* Flask
* BeautifulSoup4
* Requests

## Limitations

* Only checks for basic reflected XSS in GET requests.
* Does not handle complex JavaScript-rendered content.
* Not meant for large-scale or production scanning.

## Future Improvements

* Add support for DOM-based and stored XSS detection.
* Implement more vulnerability types like SQL Injection and CSRF.
* Improve crawling depth and JavaScript parsing.
* Add session handling and login form support.
